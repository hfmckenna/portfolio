        <h2>2017 - 2018 / Web Dev & Business Analysis</h2>
        <p>Have been studying online using Free Code Camp since 2017 and was selected for the Google Front End Development scholarship in 2018.</p>
        <p>Working for a small company my role varies and I have built reporting software with Node on a VPS, helped integrate platforms using APIs and designed a site for a new venture for the company, based on my business proposal.</p>

        <h2>2011 - 2017 / Content</h2>
        <p>I started in the "glory days" before Google's Penguin algorithm, writing blogs for Dolphin Music centred around high volume keywords.</p>
        <p>Then I became content manager for PMT Online, hiring my own little team of writers to do the blogs & product content while I focused on maintaining a legacy MySQL database, performing SEO audits and assisting an agency in migrating our Magento site.</p>
        <p>Most recently I was Head Of International content for The Hut Group. Performing technical SEO analysis on international sites, hiring translators and using the latest enterprise technologies to assist translation at scale. Driving a 300% YOY increase in revenue during the critical Q4 trading period.</p>

          <p>I'm an avid maker, creating custom guitar pedals for over 10 years and previously working as a sound engineer.</p>
          <p>It would be fair to say I found my niche working with experimental, anarchic & often bloody loud rock bands.</p>
          <p>I've still got chops when it comes to setting up a coincident stereo pair and editing in Pro Tools.</p>
          <p>Any bands or podcasters who need some specialist audio knowledge for their project are very welcome to get in touch.</p>
